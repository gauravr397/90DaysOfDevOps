# My 90-Day DevOps Learning Blueprint

## 1. My Starting Point

- **Current Level:** I am a working IT professional serving as a Release/Deployment Engineer.
- **Experience:** My role involves managing all application deployments for my organization. I have hands-on experience with core DevOps tools, including Jenkins for CI/CD, AWS for cloud infrastructure, and Docker for containerization. I also hold a Terraform Associate (004) certification, demonstrating a solid foundation in Infrastructure as Code.

## 2. My "Why"

My primary motivation for undertaking this 90-day challenge is to accelerate my career growth and secure a more advanced DevOps role. While I have a decent foundation, I aim to deepen my practical skills to confidently tackle complex, real-world engineering challenges and transition into a new, more impactful position as quickly as possible.

## 3. My 90-Day Goals

1.  **Master Advanced CI/CD:** Move beyond basic pipelines and implement a production-grade CI/CD workflow for a multi-service application, incorporating automated testing, security scanning, and progressive deployment strategies (e.g., Blue-Green or Canary).
2.  **Achieve Kubernetes Proficiency:** Deploy a containerized application on a managed Kubernetes cluster (like EKS or GKE), focusing on debugging, monitoring, and managing its lifecycle effectively.
3.  **Implement End-to-End GitOps:** Build a complete GitOps workflow using tools like Argo CD or Flux, where the state of my infrastructure and applications is declaratively managed through Git.

## 4. My Commitment to Consistency

To ensure I stay on track, my strategy is built on daily, focused effort:

- **Time Budget:** I will dedicate a minimum of 2 hours every weekday and 4 hours on weekends to this challenge.
- **Daily Micro-Learning:** I will break down complex topics into smaller, manageable tasks and commit to learning and practicing at least one small concept every single day.

This plan is my personal commitment to leveling up my skills from a deployment engineer to a well-rounded, hands-on DevOps professional.
